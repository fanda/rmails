# --- PostgreSQL ---

# For PgSQLServer you can Use a TCP/IP address or a socket. If your socket is
# in /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 specify just the path where the socket
# resits (without .s.PGSQL.5432).

PgSQLServer	127.0.0.1
PgSQLPort	5432
PgSQLUser	dspamer
PgSQLPass	remapsd
PgSQLDb		dspam

# If you're running DSPAM in client/server (daemon) mode, uncomment the
# setting below to override the default connection cache size (the number
# of connections the server pools between all clients).
#
#PgSQLConnectionCache	3

# UIDInSignature: PgSQL supports the insertion of the user id into the DSPAM
# signature. This allows you to create one single spam or fp alias
# (pointing to some arbitrary user), and the uid in the signature will
# switch to the correct user. Result: you need only one spam alias

#PgSQLUIDInSignature	on

# If you're using vpopmail or some other type of virtual setup and wish to
# change the table dspam uses to perform username/uid lookups, you can over-
# ride it below

#PgSQLVirtualTable		dspam_virtual_uids
#PgSQLVirtualUIDField		uid
#PgSQLVirtualUsernameField	username
